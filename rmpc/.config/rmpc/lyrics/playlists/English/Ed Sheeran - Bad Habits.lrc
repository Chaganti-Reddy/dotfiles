[ti:Bad Habits]
[00:00.91] One, two, three, four
[00:04.09] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:06.59] 
[00:10.55] Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
[00:18.02] Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
[00:25.62] I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
[00:32.84] And tonight had something wonderful
[00:39.28] My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
[00:43.24] Conversations with a stranger I barely know
[00:47.08] Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
[00:50.64] I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
[00:54.74] My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
[00:58.49] And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
[01:02.29] Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
[01:06.06] Nothin' happens after two, it's true
[01:09.14] It's true, my bad habits lead to you
[01:12.51] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[01:17.43] My bad habits lead to you
[01:20.26] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[01:25.15] My bad habits lead to you
[01:28.55] Every pure intention ends when the good times start
[01:36.00] Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
[01:43.86] It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
[01:51.20] I only know how to go too far
[01:57.39] My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
[02:01.36] Conversations with a stranger I barely know
[02:05.18] Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
[02:09.07] I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
[02:12.72] My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
[02:16.72] And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
[02:20.17] Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
[02:24.26] Nothin' happens after two, it's true
[02:27.34] It's true, my bad habits lead to you
[02:30.67] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[02:35.42] My bad habits lead to you
[02:38.26] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[02:44.78] We took the long way 'round
[02:52.16] And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
[02:58.25] My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
[03:02.33] Conversations with a stranger I barely know
[03:06.14] Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
[03:10.00] I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
[03:13.68] My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
[03:17.54] And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
[03:21.09] Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
[03:25.23] Nothin' happens after two, it's true
[03:28.28] It's true, my bad habits lead to you
[03:31.61] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[03:36.46] My bad habits lead to you
[03:39.35] Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[03:44.16] My bad habits lead to you
