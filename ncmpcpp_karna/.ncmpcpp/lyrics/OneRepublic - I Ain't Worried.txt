I don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe to toe
I should be scared honey maybe so

but I ain't worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

I ain't worried bout it
I ain't worried bout it

I don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out so spend it like its gold
I'm living like I’m 9 zeros
got no regrets even when I’m broke
yeah
I'm at my best when i got something
I'm wanting  to steal
way too busy for them problems
and problems to feel (yeah yeah)
no stressing just obsessin with sealin the deal
I'll take it in and let it go

but i ain't worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

I ain't worried bout it
I ain't worried bout it

I ain't worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below
I ain't worried bout it
I ain't worried bout it
I ain't worried bout it
