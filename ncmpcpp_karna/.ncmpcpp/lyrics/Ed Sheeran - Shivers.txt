oh you give me shivers

잠이 오지 않아 이밤
아마도 니가 보고 싶나봐
날 위해 노래를 불러줘
긴긴 이 꿈속에서

I kissed on your guitar
Feeling the vibration deep inside
Go dancing till the moon goes down
Oh yeah I want it all
Ooh, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that girl
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my souls on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah you got me singing like

Ooh I love it
when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance
‘til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over
then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say

Ooh I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance
‘til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over
then we'll bring it right back

Yeah
All on my own
Tryna move on
Never thought it would be you and me
Taggin' along
Singin' this song
Drunk in love like it's Hennessy
Dat dat dat dat shots
through the heart just like an AK
911 emergency we callin' mayday mayday
No honey
No drama
I need harmony like soprano
I'm no anomaly I just need
some of that good lovin' lovin'
We chasin' highs
And dodgin' lows
Heart flowing like a river oh you give me shivers

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my souls on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah you got me singing like

Ooh I love it
when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance
‘til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over
then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say

Ooh I love it
when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance
‘til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over
then we'll bring it right back

Baby you burn so hot
You make me shiver
with the fire you got
This thing we started
I don't want it to stop
you know you make me shiver

Baby you burn so hot
You make me shiver
with the fire you got
This thing we started
I don't want it to stop
you know you make me shiver
Yeah you got me singing like

Ooh I love it
when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance
‘til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over
then we'll bring it right back

Ooh I love it
when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby you wanna dance
‘til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over
then we'll bring it right back
