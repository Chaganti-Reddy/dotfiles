Open eyes.
Through the waves cut through me.
Hypnotised.
By the sounds I'm breathing in.
Hold tight, hold tight.
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.

Dripping lights.
Paint the skies.
All because of you.
Dripping lights.
Paint the skies.
Only you
Can make me move
You can make me move
Can make me move
You can make me move
Can make me....

So alive.
Make it last forever
Stopping time
Yeah I'm surrendering
Hold tight, hold tight.
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.

Dripping lights.
Paint the skies.
All because of you.
Dripping lights.
Paint the skies.
Only you
Can make me move
You can make me move
Can make me move
You can make me move
Can make me....
