This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love, (It f***ed) my head up
There’s no forgetting you

You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
More than the air that I breathe
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmmm, mmmm
I loved you dangerously

Usually, I hold the power with both my hands
Tied behind my back
Look at how things change, 'cause now you’re the train
And I’m tied to the track

You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
More than the air that I breathe
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
Baby, I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips quick goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there’s only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I’m gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you
I loved you dangerously
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
(ee ee ee ee, ee ee ee ee)
Oh, oh baby, I loved you dangerously

Mmmm, mmmm
Ooh, I loved you dangerously
Ooh ooh, I loved you dangerously
