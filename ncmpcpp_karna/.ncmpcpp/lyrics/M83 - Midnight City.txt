Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Night city grows
Look at  the horizon glow

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word(word)
Looking at the milky skyline
The city is my church(city is my church)
It wraps me in its blinding twilight

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in the car(in car)
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride time
Waiting in the car( in car)
Waiting for a ride time
Waiting in car (in car)
Waiting for a ride time
