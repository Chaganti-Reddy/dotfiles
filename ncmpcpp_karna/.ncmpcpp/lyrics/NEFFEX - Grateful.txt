always do it on my own so I gotta get through it
and the only thing I know is to love what I’m doing
never give up never slow til I finally prove it
never listen to the No’s i just wanna keep moving

keep my head up when I act
head up that’s a fact
never looking back
ima keep myself on track

keep my head up staying strong
always moving on
feel I don’t belong
tell my thoughts to move along

push myself to be the best
die with no regrets
live with every breath
see my message start to spread

and I had so many dreams
then you hit your teens
life ain’t really what it seems
try to find out what it means

always do it on my own so I gotta get through it
and the only thing I know is to love what I’m doing
never give up never slow til I finally prove it
never listen to the No’s i just wanna keep moving

yea I put out all this art, its my only medicine yea
everything I do, im just being genuine
I’m sick of being screwed, feel my own adrenaline
yea i do just what I do, and I hope you let me in let me in yea

I’m grateful

I have
only
a path
I’m lonely
but damn
I’m going
to win

I don’t want no fake love
I want the real stuff

cuz I’ll only say it once
I’m gon show you all the path

working hella hard until I get just what I want
yea rise just like the sun

shooters gonna shoot and Im gon shoot until I’ve won

always do it on my own so I gotta get through it
and the only thing I know is to love what I’m doing
never give up never slow til I finally prove it
never listen to the No’s i just wanna keep moving

yea I put out all this art, its my only medicine yea
everything I do, im just being genuine
I’m sick of being screwed, feel my own adrenaline
