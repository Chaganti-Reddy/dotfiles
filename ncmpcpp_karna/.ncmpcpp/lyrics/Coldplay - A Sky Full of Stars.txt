'Cause you're a sky
'Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky
'Cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
'Cause in a sky
'Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

'Cause you're a sky
'Cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter
the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
'Cause in a sky
'Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

So you're a sky
You're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view...
